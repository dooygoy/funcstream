    > from: [My new programming languages course](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/my-new-programming-languages-course/) I decided to use class time in an unconventional way: for each class meeting I created a “module”, consisting of a literate Haskell file with some example code, explanatory text, and lots of holes where students needed to write answers to exercises or fill in code. I split the students into groups, and they spent class time just working through the module. Instead of standing at the front lecturing, I just wandered around watching them work and answering questions. It took a bit of getting used to—for the first few classes I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t really doing my job—but it quickly became clear that the students were really learning and engaging with the material in a way that they would not have been able to if I had just lectured.

    > A happy byproduct of this approach is that the modules are fairly self-contained and can now be used by anyone to learn the material. Reading through all the modules and working through the exercises should be a great option for anyone wishing to learn some basics of programming language design and implementation. For example, I know I will probably reuse it to get summer research students up to speed. Note that the course assumes no knowledge of Haskell (so those familiar with Haskell can safely skip the first few modules), but introduces just enough to get where I want to go.

* [Letter to a Young Haskell Enthusiast](http://comonad.com/reader/2014/letter-to-a-young-haskell-enthusiast/)
> The following letter is not about what "old hands" know and newcomers do not. Instead, it is about lessons that we all need to learn more than once, and remind ourselves of. It is about tendencies that are common, and understandable, and come with the flush of excitement of learning any new thing that we understand is important, and about the difficulty, always, in trying to decide how best to convey that excitement and sense of importance to others, in a way that they will listen. It is written more specifically, but only because I have found that if we don't talk specifics as well as generalities, the generalities make no sense. This holds for algebraic structures, and it holds for other, vaguer concepts no less. It is a letter full of things I want to remember, as well as of advice I want to share. I expect I will want to remind myself of it when I encounter somebody who is wrong on the internet, which, I understand, may occur on rare occasion.
* [Monday Morning Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/)
> At Monday Morning Haskell, we have tutorials for all levels of programmers! If you're new to Haskell, take a look at our Beginners series. If you have some experience with the language already, we've got some more Advanced material so you can get started on real world projects! Either way, come back every Monday morning for some new material on the Blog!
* [Why are partial functions (as in `head`, `tail`) bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5n51u3/why_are_partial_functions_as_in_head_tail_bad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
>The problem with partial functions is that they're liars. Consider head: its type is [a] -> a, which means "give me a list of as and I'll give you an a". So I give it [] - does it give me an a? No, it doesn't, it throws an exception instead.
And when functions start lying about the things they return, you can no longer reason about them.
 * [Applied Haskell Syllabus](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/syllabus)
 > Applied Haskell is a commercial training program focusing on teaching intermediate Haskell. The goal is to help someone move from knowing Haskell basics to being able to write commercial software, with enough knowledge to pick up any new skills needed on demand.
 * [Haskell Learn - FPComplete](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn)
 * [An introduction to recursion schemes](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/introduction-to-recursion-schemes.html)
> Because nested structures appear in almost every problem domain and programming environment, from databases to 3D graphics to filesystems, the act of iterating through these structures is common, so common that most programmers barely notice when they’re doing it. As such, generalizing the act of recursive traversals provides immediate real-world benefits: our new generalized traversal can replace a host of type-specific traversal functions. In addition, by decoupling how a function recurses over data from what the function actually does, we reduce cognitive overhead and can focus entirely on the core behavior of our recursive functions.

 > In fact, I hope to get you to invent them now if you haven't already. It's then a small step to notice that all of these solutions are in fact the same solution in disguise. And after reading this, you might be in a better position to understand other documents on monads because you'll recognise everything you see as something you've already invented.

 * [Space Leak Zoo](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/05/space-leak-zoo/)
 > There are a few different types of space leak here, but they are quite different and a visitor would do well not to confuse them (the methods for handling them if encountered in the wild vary, and using the wrong technique could exacerbate the situation).
 * [Money in the type system where it belongs](https://ren.zone/articles/safe-money)
 > Notwithstanding the value civilization gives to a particular currency, the amount of said currency one owns can't spontaneously increase nor decrease in number. As programmers, we do play a crucial role in ensuring amounts of currency are never made up nor lost. In this article we will explore how we can leverage types, functional programming, and in particular the safe-money Haskell library to ensure that our software deals with monetary values and world currencies as carefully as civilization requires. Mostly, we will be exploring the type system and learning how to reason through types.
 * [Embedding Linear Lambda Calculus, Quickly and Easily](https://blog.functorial.com/posts/2017-08-05-Embedding-Linear-Lambda-Calculus.html)
  > Suppose you want to create an embedded DSL based on the linear lambda calculus. Why might you want to do this? Well, you might want to control access to some resource, or perhaps you've heard that linear types can change the world and now you'd like to compile your EDSL to some target language and optimize things using mutable data structures.
 * [Imperative Haskell](https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2017/05/29/imperative-haskell/)

 > In the meantime, in the interest of both sharing with others the small amount of wisdom I’ve gained and preserving it for my future self, I’ve decided to write a long, rather dry overview of a few select parts of the Haskell workflow I developed and the ecosystem I settled into. 
 * [Functor-Oriented Programming](http://r6.ca/blog/20171010T001746Z.html)
 > My style of Haskell programming has been evolving over the 15 years that I have been working with it. It is turning into something that I would like to call “functor oriented programming”. The traditional use of typed functional programming focuses on data types. One defines data types to model the data structures that your program operates on, and one writes functions to transform between these structures. One of the primary goals in this traditional methodology is to create data structures that exclude erroneous states to the extent that is reasonably possible. As long as one ensures that pattern matching is complete, then the type system catches many errors that would otherwise lead to these erroneous states, which have been crafted to be unrepresentable. Functor oriented programming is a refinement of this traditional focus on data types.

 > This is a demonstration program that is able to load a web page up and render it like in the early 90's. It supports laying out text, different font sizes for headings, inline and block elements, hyperlinks, bold and italics. It supports mousewheel scrolling, too. I wrote this in a couple evenings, because it seemed straight-forward to do so given the libraries available today. That's a good sign for Haskell. Also, there's an inarticulate gut feeling I have that tells me maybe it's worth celebrating these days in which the web is still viewable in its simplest, earliest form.

## Inspirational

* [Wallace Stevens - Thea idea of order at Key West](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43431/the-idea-of-order-at-key-west)
>  The sea was not a mask. No more was she.   
The song and water were not medleyed sound   
Even if what she sang was what she heard,   
Since what she sang was uttered word by word.
It may be that in all her phrases stirred   
The grinding water and the gasping wind;   
But it was she and not the sea we heard.
