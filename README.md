# Haskell and functional thinking process

This is an exploration of a beautiful programming language Haskell and functional thinking.
I am learning from several books and documenting the learning here.
The books used are

  * Richard Bird: Thinking Functionally with Haskell
  * Graham Hutton: Programming in Haskell
  * Simon Thompson: Haskell - The Craft of Functional Programming
  * Allen/Moronuki: Haskell From First Principles
  * Will Kurt: Get Programming with Haskell
  * Hudak/Quick: The Haskell School of Music
