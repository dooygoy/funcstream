> This is a demonstration program that is able to load a web page up and render it like in the early 90's. It supports laying out text, different font sizes for headings, inline and block elements, hyperlinks, bold and italics. It supports mousewheel scrolling, too. I wrote this in a couple evenings, because it seemed straight-forward to do so given the libraries available today. That's a good sign for Haskell. Also, there's an inarticulate gut feeling I have that tells me maybe it's worth celebrating these days in which the web is still viewable in its simplest, earliest form.
