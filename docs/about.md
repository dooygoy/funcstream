# Functional programming with Haskell

This is an exploration of a beautiful programming language Haskell and functional programming.
I am learning from several books and documenting the learning here. There are
Haskell related links and I will attempt to write short reviews on each, and then
there are observation that are following books I currently read, often using
real life analogies and examples.

I find that observing code not just through
numbers but through seemingly unrelated analogies enables me in turn to get a
better grasp at numbers. When I try to explain some Haskell code to people who
do not know programming I notice they intuitively *do* get programming, it's just
the thing with numbers is that they can induce heavy feelings of guilt or remind
them on how bad were they in math which is only the fault of the teachers and
their reluctance and to bring clarity that is also rich with a variety of
conceptual examples that are not just stiff images but life like analogies that
motivate and *remind* the human about processes they are familiar with that are in
their essence programming, and not just that but at their core, functional
programming. There will be *errors* and before your vents go off please notice that
I am thinking in what  you could call a *free jazz improvisational* method, or
the so called Miles Davis *there are no wrong notes* method in which after you
make a mistake you do not *correct* the mistake but find a new turn from which
the wrong note, or sound will *sound* correct. Such exploration may be tedious
in the beginning, and yet this *spaced error repetition* eventually builds a
different kind of knowledge, one that goes from errors to correctness, from
exploring a variety of *mistakes* to a much richer *correct* understanding of
the issue at hand. It also reduces the memory footprint since by pruning the
errors and developing from them, our understanding becomes capable of a much
wider web of connections. If one orients on just being correct it is possible to
induce higher stress levels since one is always striving for correctness
