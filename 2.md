# Lists

## Sameness and otherness

**Homogeneity and heterogeneity** are concepts relating to the uniformity in a substance or organism. A material or image that is **homogeneous** is uniform in composition or character (i.e. color, shape, size, weight, height, distribution, texture, language, income, disease, temperature, design, etc.); one that is **heterogeneous** is distinctly nonuniform in one of these qualities. The name comes from ancient greek meaning *homos* - same and *heteros* - different.
But notice an element may be homogeneous on a larger scale, compared to being heterogenous on a smaller scale as well. 

In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once. The standard way of implementing lists, originating with the programming language Lisp, is to have each element of the list contain both its value and a pointer indicating the location of the next element in the list. This results in either a linked list or a tree, depending on whether the list has nested sublists. Lists that contain other lists are called **nested lists**.

Here are some lists in Lisp
```
(blue green black)
((blue sky) (green earth) (black hole))
((blue sky) loves (black holes))
```
All these lists have three elements meaning the length of the list is independent of the complexity of its elements. Each element of a list could be visualised as a potential tree with many possible branches or nested lists flowing from it. Sometimes in our daily interactios we write these lists as bullet points and then we fill these bullet points with further lists of items. Now, a list of zero elements is called an empty list. It has no cons (constructor) cells. In Lisp it is written as an empty pair of parentheses `()`and in Haskell as an empty pair of brackets `[]`. We call it Nil. Nil seems to be practical since it can tell us whether a certain list is empty at all. 

Notice Lisp uses parentheses for lists and practically everything.Haskell uses brackets for lists and parentheses for several other concepts. For example in Haskell tuples are represented with parenthesis. What is a tuple? Simply said for now, a tuple is a finite heterogeneous data structure meaning it has a fixed lenght of elements and each element has a different type. It is also like a row in a table or a database where each column represents a different element - for example four columns of elements such as: `person, age, gender, number` would mean that the row `"Linda", 29, Female, 385` would constitute a finite heterogeneous 4-tuple. Notice this row has elements of a different type since Linda and 29 cannot be added to one another (why would we?) while if we had "Linda" and "Domagoj" these two character strings could be added or concatenated meaning we could have a homogenous list or a sequence of `(Linda Domagoj)` **Tuples have structure, lists have order**. In Haskell tuples have different types and the lenght is fixed while lists have values of the same type and the lenght is not fixed.

Practical Haskell:

> Lists in Haskell are *homogeneous*: each list can handle elements of only a single type. Because of that, you are forbidden to create a list containing integers and characters and also to concatenate two lists with different kinds of elements.

But how are the elements connected within a list?
Lists in Haskell and Lisp are linked lists. Such lists are composed of a series of cells that hold the values in a list and a reference to the next cell and a special marker for the end of the list. The basic operations to construct lists are `[]` (pronounced "nil") to create an empty list and `(:)` (pronounced "cons") to append an element to an already existing list. So first literals can also be written as follows:

``` 
Prelude> 1 : 2 : 3 : []
[1,2,3]

Prelude> 'a' : 'b' : 'c' : []
"abc"
```
In Lisp (acronym for List Processor) list is the central data type.
